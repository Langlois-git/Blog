# Welcome 👋

Hey — I’m **David Langlois**.

I’m currently studying for a **Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and Computer Science**, and I started this blog as a place to think out loud, learn in public, and turn messy notes into clear explanations.

Here you’ll find posts on:
- **Coding** (projects, tips, experiments, and tools I’m learning)
- **Math** (from fundamentals to deeper concepts, explained in a practical way)
- **Problem-solving** (how I approach tricky questions and build intuition)

My goal is simple: **make complex ideas easier to understand**—for you *and* for future me.

Thanks for stopping by, and welcome to the journey.
